# Debstechcafe
## Project Description

This project is a Educational Technology website named Debstechcafe built by using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. For hosting I have used Azure App Service, Azure App Service provides a highly scalable, self-patching web hosting service. It deploys a basic HTML5 + CSS3 site to Azure App Service and it runs commands locally with Azure CLI.
## Azure Technologies
Following are some key features of Azure App Service that made me choose this service:
1. Azure App Service is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends. 
2. Applications run and scale with ease on both Windows and Linux-based environments. 
3. App Service not only adds the power of Microsoft Azure to your application, such as security, load balancing, autoscaling, and automated management.
4. You can also take advantage of its DevOps capabilities, such as continuous deployment from Azure DevOps, GitHub, Docker Hub, and other sources, package management, staging environments, custom domain, and TLS/SSL certificates.
5. Dedicated tools in Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code streamline the work of creating, deploying, and debugging.
